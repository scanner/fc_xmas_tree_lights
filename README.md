This is a control program for a Raspberry Pi with the Adafruit 16x2
LCD shield and a fadecandy driving a number of strings of LED's
wrapped around a Christmas tree.

In our configuration there are six strings of 50 LED's wrapped with
string 0 at the bottom of the tree and successive strings where the
first leaves off. This gives us an ordered way of addressing the
lights and some of the constants in this program use this fact to
provide certain animations (like snow falling)
